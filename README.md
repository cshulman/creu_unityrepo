Created for CREU project using Unity.
This game was created based on this  https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/creating-basic-platformer-gametutorial tutorial of a Simple Platform Controller game in Unity, using C# scripts.
After completing this tutorial the game consisted of a hero, "Mr. Peanut Guy", who jumped between platforms to catch coins.

Since completing the tutorial several features have been added:
 - Multiple levels: the game now consists of 4 levels instead of one. In each level the ground platforms fall at an increased rate.
 - Scorekeeping: when our hero collides with a coin, our scorekeeper will keep track. Once 10 coins are collected, the next level is invoked.

TODO:
 - Add a Game Over / You Win text scene that ends the game once the 4 levels are completed.
 - Add GUI text in the current scenes that display what level and score the player achieved.
 - Add a continue to next level text scene when it is time to advance to the next level. Possibly include Yes/No buttons in these scenes that will allow the user to resume the new level and game at a later time.
